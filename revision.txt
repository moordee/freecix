Here are some things that needs improvement:
1. Move the controls BESIDE the avatar
2. Hair doesn't render properly
3. Put outline between elements to distinguish them from other facial elements
4. Clothes render very badly
5. You have to render the body from head to upper chest, not just the head
6. All the head coverings don't render properly
7. Most of the beards and moustaches are misplaced and rendered badly
8. The hairstyle and length are completely off. Feel free to scribble lines to make them more realistic.
9. make the eye shapes variant more realistic
10. The animal masks are badly fitted to the face and lack some important details. Feel free to scribble over them to add more details
11. Missing features: nose shapes, mouth shapes, ears shape
12. The ears are rendered so poorly
13. Face moles sizes are way to big

Feel free to scribble all over each elements to dd more details and make them look more realistic. I've attached a file full of pictures of facial features so you can model the improved versions after them.

Just tell me where I need to put all of the new codes since I already have them in my laptop.
